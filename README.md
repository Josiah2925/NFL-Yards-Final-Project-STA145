# NFL-Yards-Final-Project-STA145
This is my replication package for the STA-145 final project. I measured how many yards each NFL team gained per play in 2017 and how each play correlated with rushing yards that season.
# Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA145-Noblej3.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the - Descriptive Statistics Table (Individual) - Sheet1.csv" file. 
# Data Description
The dataset used in this project was provided by the course instructor and saved as data.csv in my ELSA drive. The dataset contains information about football team performance metrics, including offensive statistics such as yards per play, rushing yards, passing yards, scoring, and additional team characteristics. Each row of the dataset represents one NCAA college football team, and each column represents a measurable performance statistic.

For this project, I focus specifically on two variables:
Yards Per Play – a measure of overall offensive efficiency
Rushing Yards – the total number of yards gained by rushing plays

These variables provide insight into whether teams that rush more effectively also tend to gain more yards per play overall. Understanding this relationship can help explain whether strong rushing performance contributes to broader offensive efficiency, an important question for sports analytics, coaching strategy, and performance evaluation.
# Operationalization 
1. Yards Per Play (Continuous Variable)
* Conceptual definition: Offensive efficiency, or the average yards gained per offensive play.
* Operational definition: The numeric value provided in the dataset labeled yards_per_play, measured in yards.
* Level of measurement: Continuous (ratio).
* Why it matters: Higher numbers mean a more efficient offense.

2. Rushing Yards (Continuous Variable)
* Conceptual definition: How productive the rushing offense is.
* Operational definition: The numeric value in the dataset labeled rushing_yards, representing total rushing yards gained.
* Level of measurement: Continuous (ratio).
* Why it matters: Teams with more rushing yards can control possession and field position.
